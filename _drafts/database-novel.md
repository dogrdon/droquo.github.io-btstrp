Before picking up Georges Perec's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_A_User's_Manual" target="_blank">Life A User's Manual</a>, it had not occurred to me that a novel could be, at essence, structured data. 

Or rather, it might have occurred to me in the sense that books comprise a few predictable units, situated together: words beget paragraphs, paragraphs beget chapters, chapters comprise sections or parts (optional) and parts align to make an entire book. But it had not occurred to me that the elements of a novel, its content, the situations and items that inspire the plot or narrative might assemble as if a relational database or a conventional data structure.

Or such is the sense I get when reviewing the wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_A_User's_Manual#The_constraints"> section </a> for this novel describing the constraints Perec used to craft his work.

<blockquote><b>The constraints</b>
These elements come together with Perec's constraints for the book (in keeping with Oulipo objectives): he created a complex system which would generate for each chapter a list of items, references or objects which that chapter should then contain or allude to. He described this system as a "machine for inspiring stories".

There are 42 lists of 10 objects each, gathered into 10 groups of 4 with the last two lists a special "Couples" list. Some examples:

<ul>
<li>number of people involved</li>
<li>length of the chapter in pages</li>
<li>an activity</li>
<li>a position of the body</li>
<li>emotions</li>
<li>an animal</li>
<li>reading material</li>
<li>countries</li>
<li>2 lists of novelists, from whom a literary quotation is required</li>
<li>"Couples", e.g. Pride and Prejudice, Laurel and Hardy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

And it dawns on me: is it possible to write a novel first as if filling out a spreadsheet or set of form fields? To conceive of the objects necessary for a plot, assign them numbers, hierarchies, and a taxonomic spot in line from which to create a presentation from and <em> then </em> write the book?

If so, this would truly change the game for me. And the game for anyone who is trying to really meld the disparate fields of book writing and computer wrangling.
