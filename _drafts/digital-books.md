While scoping a solution for a recent digital project involving the digitization of some old books, I started to wonder what it is that makes for a satisfying user experience when it comes to handling digitized books. Particulary historically significant medieval texts, books that are in and of themselves as much works of art and craftsmenship as they are vehicles for information. It caused me to question what it is that would make a book in digital format true to its historical character, but also useful and compelling in a contemporary fashion. Isn't that what we want to achieve by digitizing these physical objects, after all? To preserve their presense in a way that maintains their integrity, but also to preserve their relevance for the entire audience. 

The question that I keep revisiting has to do with a few colleagues who, when reviewing possible software possibilities we might use to implement a digital browser for these works, pointed out that they did not like the fact that a certain browser did not give the use the interaction of seeing the "pages turning". The viewer in question, admitedly, was more like a slideshow, with each page of the book individually displayed, allowing the user to zoom into it and move to sections of it close up.

While I acknowledge the desire to have the same interaction at the digital level as I would at the analog level, I don't feel that the page turning illusion really added very much to the experience. Instead, I almost feel as if it removes and distracts from the experience. Perhaps it's me thinking the entire time, with my particular point of view and the fact that ultimately I will be the one responsible for implementing this solution technologically: "How would one get this to work on a code level?" And in that, I am distracted and, while drawn in by the marvel of seeing th pages turn digitally, I am no longer paying any attention to the work being represented. It's there, but I am too caught up in the technology. 

Sometimes being caught up in the technology is the goal. It is the smoke and mirrors that is there to shore up underwhelming content. But why puff up content that's already amazing? And what then caught me was that here I am thinking of 500 year old medical texts as "content".    

When making design desisions, no matter what, you have to leave out somethings, and include things at the expense of other features or affordibilities. It comes down to a matter of time, money, or conviction, or persuassion. So I am not sure if I am correct on this or not, or if there is any correct answer.
